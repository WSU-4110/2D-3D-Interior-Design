Topic: Progress
We disucussed the progress we made after deciding to swtich. We have decided to use blender to run the functions in the web page. We have completed redoing our login page (front end) and the homepage. We are going to use docker as a server because it will allow us to use blender in the web page without having the user install it. We are planning to get the docker server running within the week, and the backend of the login page done. Th about page of our web app is still in progress, and we are going to work on the contact page. We are looking into using Canva as well to make the 2d models.

Topic: Retrospective 
Discussion: We talked about what to do in the next sprint and if we should change our current plan. We have decided to figure out what software we are going to use to make 
the 2d and 3d componenets of our softwware. We talked about the problems we faced last sprint and how to work on them. The problems we are facing are integrating with github and 
working on the 2d to 3d part of our project. We decided that we are going to give ourselves more specific tasks so their is no misunderstandings, and that we may be switching from using 
python to javascript libraries, as there is more options and resources. We will have this decided by next thursday at the latest.
