Topic: Retrospective 
Discussion: We talked about what to do in the next sprint and if we should change our current plan. We have decided to figure out what software we are going to use to make 
the 2d and 3d componenets of our softwware. We talked about the problems we faced last sprint and how to work on them. The problems we are facing are integrating with github and 
working on the 2d to 3d part of our project. We decided that we are going to give ourselves more specific tasks so their is no misunderstandings, and that we may be switching from using 
python to javascript libraries, as there is more options and resources. We will have this decided by next thursday at the latest.
