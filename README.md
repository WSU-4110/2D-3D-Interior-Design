- Create an account and login
- Contact us easily through the web page
- Leave a review to the website
- Create a 2D drawing of your layout, you can draw your room, furniture, windows, and doors.
- Save your drawing to your computer

## Our Purpose 
We are a team of college students who created this project because we wanted interior design to be easier. Between having to move things into dorms, or managing adult life from home, deciding how to design your space can be a large task. We wanted to make this task as easy as possible, not only for us, but anyone who has a space they need to design.
      
## Why Use Our Project?
There are many ways to make a 2D design layout, but why use ours? Ours is set apart by allow the user to convert their design to a 3D model. This is a unique ability and is extremely helpful for translating ideas on paper, into something applicable to the real world. Our web application is very user friendly, making it suitable for people of technological abilities. Our app also has a built in function to save your 2D drawing directly to your computer, making it easy to print or view later. The freedom given to you by our drawing function also allows you to account for any unique room or furniture you may have, that is not available as a preset option in other applicatons.
